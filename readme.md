This is a simple web app that integrates with the undocumented NHL API.
This is version one of a larger application I am currently undergoing.

User Requirements V1:

1. Search for any player that is currently on an NHL team roster.
2. Must search for player by complete full name
3. If there are multiple players matching the name in question then output all relevant players to the screen with their accompanying statistics.

- Search for 'Sebastian Aho' to see an example of how I handle players with the same name
